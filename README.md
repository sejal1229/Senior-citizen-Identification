# Senior-citizen-Identification
Develop a machine learning model to detect age and gender in  from video, identify individuals over 60 as senior citizens, and record their age, gender, and visit time in a CSV file.
## To simply run this model:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the [Senior citizen detection.py](https://github.com/poojachowdary9866/Senior-citizen-Identification/blob/main/senior%20citizen%20detection%20.py) file
3. Upload the video you want to detect
4. View results in [Results.csv](https://github.com/poojachowdary9866/Senior-citizen-Identification/blob/main/results.csv) file 

## To Run this Model yourself:
1. Clone this repository
2. Download the dataset from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new)
3. Extract the dataset to your repository folder.
4. Open the [Model jupyter notebook](https://github.com/poojachowdary9866/Senior-citizen-Identification/blob/main/model-1.ipynb)
5. Run this notebook
6. Run the [Senior citizen detection.py](https://github.com/poojachowdary9866/Senior-citizen-Identification/blob/main/senior%20citizen%20detection%20.py) file
7. Upload the video you want to detect
8. View results in [Results.csv](https://github.com/poojachowdary9866/Senior-citizen-Identification/blob/main/results.csv) file
